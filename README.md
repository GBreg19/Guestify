## Technologies Used

- React: The core library for building the user interface.
- TypeScript: The primary language used for enhanced type checking and code quality.
- TailwindCSS: Used for styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.
- Redux Toolkit: Utilized for state management, providing a structured and efficient way to manage application data.
- Node.js/Express: Used as the backend server to handle requests.
- MongoDB: The database system for storing and retrieving data.

## Backend Setup

To connect to the MongoDB server, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository: Use `git clone` to clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the backend folder: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the backend directory within the project folder.

3. Install dependencies: Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the backend.

4. Start the backend server: Use the following command to start the backend server on port 4000: "npm start"


The backend server will be up and running, allowing you to send requests to the MongoDB server and access the project's data.

## Frontend Setup

To set up the React frontend, follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the frontend folder: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the frontend directory within the project folder.

2. Install frontend dependencies: Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.

3. Start the development server: Use the following command to start the React frontend in development mode: "npm run dev"


The development server for the React frontend will be running, and you can access the application in your web browser.
